This website was inspired by tragic stories of travelers who lost their life in the wild, unable to find their way home.
Their stories would have ended differently had the help arrived in time. Unfortunately, nobody knew where to look for them. Have fun, enjoy the wild and most of all, stay safe!</h2>
