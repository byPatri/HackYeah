Aim of the web application:
The aim of the application is to increase safety among those who like to spend their time actively. It can be used by hikers, climbers, surfers, kayakers and any other nature enthusiasts.
This website was inspired by tragic stories of travellers who lost their life in the wild, unable to find their way home. Their stories would have ended differently had the help arrived in time. Unfortunately, nobody knew where to look for them. 
The app enables a user to upload  details about his or her trip, such as starting and ending points , date, estimated time of return, route details, health condition and a person to contact in case of emergency. If a user doesn't tag a trip as finished at the time he or she planned to get back, the contact person would be notified with an e-mail containing the trip details.
The app was created to make rescuers' work to find a missing person easier and thus to increase his or her chances to survive. If a missing person gives no signs of life  for more than 24 hours, the contact person has not only the trip details to hand over to recuers, but also the person's health condition. 

How it works:
The app enables you to sign up and create you own profile. In the user panel you can add a new trip and display details of already finished ones.
You can add the following information to your new trip: start and end points, start and end date and time, route details (which trails you will use, where you will have a coffee break etc.), additional comment and of course a contact person details - his or her name and phone number. 
Additionally, there are some extra information about user's health condition in user profile settings.

Still to do:
Synchronizing backend and frontend.
Adding responsiveness.
A feature allowing the user to check in on the route whenever cellular connection is available. That way the approximate location and possible search area will be limited to a smaller radius.
A funcionality that lets the user claim a delay with a simple click of a button.
Integration of the route into google maps to create a visual map of the journey.

Business plan:
We intend to introduce users to our website for free. At this point we will accept voluntary donations. We hope to partner up with sport communities and organizations (eg. Polish PTTK) to promote our idea. As the operation grows we would like to enable ads to monetize the project or add a sign up fee.
